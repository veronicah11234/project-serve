            <p>
                <p>Tourist places in Nairobi that are worth visiting are National Museum, Railway Museum, Giraffe Centre, Karen Blixen, Karura Forest, David Sheldrick Trust Elephant Orphan Centre, Ngong Hills, Blue Sky Tours in Diamond Plaza, Nairobi Arboretum, Panari Sky Centre, Bomas of Kenya, Uhuru Garden, GP Karting, Village Market<span id="dots">...</span>
                    <span class="more"> Mamba Village, Paintball Fury Limited, Maasai Ostrich Farm, Paradise Lost, August Memorial Park, Kenya National Archives, KICC, Art Centres and Nairobi National Park. Kenya’s largest city and capital, Nairobi implores diversity in romance and puts forward exalted adventure. The city transformed from a meek camp for the railway employees in the year 1899 to the capital named British East Africa by the year 1907. Today, the rich retrospective history and tribal culture and lifestyle are brought to life through its excellent and knowledgeable museums. In particular, the museum named Karen Blixen Museum is one of the biggest hits – not only the African fans come to praise and appreciate the museum but also people from all over the world visit the museum to view the namesake Danish author who with drudgeries toiled on the coffee farmstead in the midst of the beautiful Ngong Hills. Even in such a scampering city like Nairobi, wildlife is a colossal draw. Being a cosmopolitan capital, Nairobi is the only city in the globe that brags a safari park within its frontiers.<br><br>

 

                        The travelers can relish a classic African wildlife escapade at the Nairobi National Park which is a fifteen-minute jaunt from the skyscrapers of the megalopolis. Animals like buffalo, giraffe, rhinoceros, zebra, cheetah, lion and wildebeest meander under the sun-soaked grassy plain in the tropical or subtropical region neighboring meager trees. Here animal lovers too get a chance to clasp, cuddle and embrace the baby elephants and yoke with the giraffes at the spectacular animal sanctuary located nearby. However, with a fabulous and spectacular national park located at the doorstep of the wildlife centric charismatic attractions, Nairobi maddens on, jars and counterpoints on the beautiful and glorious natural beauty. The polarising outlook and character of Nairobi assure rapturing ecstasy to the city. Also, the gateway to the world-class and popular Kenya’s safari parks, Nairobi attracts gripping seekers of adventure for over a century.<br><br></span></p>

                <p>Traversing three hours west of Nairobi, this crumbling provincial town which is also the capital of the Mara region. It is the final proper centre prior to the vast grasslands of the Masai Mara. It is a surprising and friendly hassle free place that offers few travellers with a reason to stop and unwind. A lot of people roll on in, browse the curio shops when the driver refuels before you begin rolling on out again.

                    <span class="dots">...</span>
                    <span class="more"> Situated west of Nairobi, it has very well been capable of supporting the economy of Kenya in the south west of the country along the Great Rift Valley. It is the district capital of the Narok County which also stands as the principal centre of commerce in the district. With a population of some 40,000 people that largely comprises of Maasai people, Narok is still as pristine as ever. 

                        The Maasai, natives of the Narok district regard Narok as the Enkare Narok which has been named after the river which passes through the Narok town. It is a beautifully town that definitely deserves a visit when you have taken a trip to Kenya</span></p>
